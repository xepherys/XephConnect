# XephConnect
Daughter Board / Breakout Board for moving Duet connections to the tool.

This PCB design is being created for the RailCore II to move carriage-based connections (extruder steppers, thermistor, heater, Y-stop) to the tool using a single wire harness.

The idea for this started with my desire to create a tool carriage for the M3D QuadFusion, which has four (4) extruder steppers, but being able to run a single connector up to the tool that can swap between the QuadFusion and the E3D standard hotends.
